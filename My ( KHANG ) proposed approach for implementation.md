We should take into account these:

My suggestion is :

# Difficulty of the Problem Interest:

Predicting stock prices represents a significant challenge in the field of financial analysis, primarily due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the variables influencing these price movements.

- **Market Volatility:** Stock markets are inherently volatile, with prices often influenced by numerous factors that can change rapidly. This volatility makes it difficult to identify consistent patterns or trends that can be reliably used for prediction.
- **Influence of global events:** Global events such as political changes, natural disasters, pandemics, or major technological advancements can drastically affect stock prices. These events are often unpredictable and add an additional layer of complexity to stock price prediction.
- **Economic Inddicators:** Economic indicators like GDP, unemployment rates, inflation rates etc., also impact stock prices. Predicting these economic indicators themselves is a challenging task.
- **Company-Specific Factors:** Each company's stock price is affected by factors specific to that company, such as earnings reports, changes in leadership, new product launches or recalls, and more. These factors can be difficult to track and quantify for prediction purposes.
- **Non-Linear Relationships:** The relationship between these influencing factors and the stock price is not linear or straightforward. Traditional statistical methods often fail to capture these non-linear relationships making prediction even more challenging.
- **High Dimensionality:** Stock price prediction involves dealing with high-dimensional data (data with a large number of features). Handling high-dimensional data is problematic due to the "curse of dimensionality," which can lead to overfitting and other issues.
- **Noise in data :** Financial markets data often contains 'noise' - random variations that are not useful for predictions and can lead to misguided conclusions if not properly handled.
- **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) :** Lastly, it's worth mentioning the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which suggests that at any given time, stock prices fully reflect all available information, making it impossible to consistently achieve return on investment higher than average market returns.

â†’ Given these complexities, while machines and algorithms can assist us in making educated predictions about future stock trends based on historical data and pattern detection, predicting exact future prices remains an elusive goal in finance.

*( then we shoulds introduce some machine learning algorithms we coded, explain why we choose them, how we evaluate them,â€¦ )* ðŸ‘‡

# The appropriateness & quality of the chosen method/solution

**IDK WHAT ML MODEL WE WILL CHOOSE AFTER COMPLETING ALL OF THEM, BUT I THINK NO MATTER WHICH ONE WE CHOOSE, WEâ€™LL NEED TO CONSIDER THESE FACTORS:\**

**TIME SERIES MODELS (Optional):** Traditional time-series models like ARIMA or GARCH can handle temporal dependencies and may provide decent results when data exhibits strong temporal patterns. However, they might fail to capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.

**MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS :** Machine learning models such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting can capture non-linear patterns and interactions between different variables. But these models often require careful feature engineering and selection to perform well.

**DEEP LEARNING MODELS :** Neural network-based methods, particularly Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and other Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), can be very effective due to their ability to handle sequential data, capturing complex patterns over time. However, they could be prone to overfitting if not properly regularized and they require large amounts of data to train effectively.

**HYBRID MODELS (Optional):** Hybrid models that combine traditional time-series models with machine learning or deep learning models can sometimes offer improved performance by leveraging the strengths of each approach.

*( We implemented Linear Regression, LSTM, we should add two more, Random Forest and SVM, then we should compare them and go for the best one ).*

**QUALITY OF DATA PREPROCESSING :** The quality of preprocessing steps such as dealing with missing values, outliers, and scaling also greatly influences the model's performance.

**FEATURE ENGINEERING** : Selecting relevant features and engineering new features plays a crucial role in improving the performance of machine learning models.

**FINE-TUNING:** Proper tuning of hyperparameters is essential to achieve optimal model performance. Grid search or random search methods can be employed to find the best parameters.

**ROBUSTNESS:** The method should be robust enough to handle noise and anomalies in the stock market data without significant degradation in performance.

# The rigor of your evaluation on the chosen method/solution

Data splitting:**Carefully splitting your data into training, validation (for hyperparameter tuning), and testing sets is crucial. Often, time series data needs a chronological split to maintain the temporal order of observations.**

Cross-validation:**Due to the temporal nature of stock prices, traditional cross-validation isn't always suitable. Instead, time series cross-validation or walk-forward validation can be used.**

Model Performance Metrics ( ITâ€™S VERY EASY ):**Use appropriate performance metrics to evaluate your model. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-Squared are commonly used metrics for regression problems like stock price prediction.**

Residual Analysis:**Analyze the residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) to check for any pattern left uncaught by the model.**

Robustness checck : **Check how well your model performs under different market conditions (bullish, bearish, volatile).**

Overfiiting and underfitting check : **Monitor learning curves to ensure your model is not overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data) or underfitting (performing poorly on both training and testing data).**
