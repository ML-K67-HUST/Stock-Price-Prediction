This repository was created from November 25 2023 to serve the capstone project or the cource Introduction to Artificial Intelligent in HUST. 

## ABOUT THE MARKDOWN FILES:

**Proposed_Approach.md** : This is the old markdown file we created when starting the project. This file documents what we want to do, should do, and will do after discussing with each other, in order to complete the project in the best possible way, based on the criteria set by the teacher for a good project.

**Report.md** : Including what we want to write in the report. In consists of :

- Introduction
- Data Preparation
- Machine Learning Models:
  - LSTM
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
- Code Components
- Results
- Difficulties
- Libraries

  Like a miniature of this repository :)
  
## ABOUT THE FOLDER:

**DATA** : Where we store our collected data, as well as the place we implemented the data crawling system.
- Files for data collecting :
  - crawling_data.ipynb
    or crawling_data.py
- Acquired stock price historical data :
  - AAPL
  - GOOG
  - MSFT
  - GSPC
  - VFS
    
**MACHINE LEARNING** : Every Machine Learning - Based Algorithm we implemented to find the answer for the close price. Including:
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- K Nearest Neighboor
- Random Forest
- Long Short Term Memory
- Support Vector Machine
  
6 algorithms in total, but we only found 4 of them was appropriate to predicting numerical stock price (You should pay your attetion to Decision Tree, KNN, Linear Regression and LSTM

**SCRIPT FOR MAKING SLIDES** : 
  We (each member individually) have incorporated our key points into the slides. During the presentation, we will rely on those script lines to articulate our thoughts. Script synthesis is aimed at making the slide creation (handled by one member) more cohesive, instead of having multiple people working on slides simultaneously.
